# MINESWEEPER_Pr8
The "Text-Based Minesweeper Game in Python" project is designed to offer a console-based rendition of the well-known puzzle game Minesweeper. It provides an interactive, text-based setting for players to experience the game's challenge, where they reveal cells on a grid while avoiding hidden mines.
